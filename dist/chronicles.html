		<h1>Met Gala's Reminiscence</h1>
		<p>The Met Gala, officially known as the Metropolitan
      Museum of Art Costume Institute Gala, started in 1948. It
      was founded by publicist Eleanor Lambert. The event was
      originally a fundraising gala for the newly established
      Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in
      New York City. The aim was to raise money for the
      institute and to generate interest in fashion and costume
      history.</p>
		<img src="cou2.jpeg">
		<p>Over the years, the Met Gala has evolved from a modest
      fundraising event into one of the most prominent and
      glamorous fashion gatherings in the world, thanks in part
      to the involvement of key figures like Anna Wintour. It
      continues to serve as a major fundraiser for the Costume
      Institute and an influential platform for celebrating fashion
      and culture.</p>

		<h1>THE FASHION ILLUSTRATION RETROSPECTIVE</h1>
		<p>Fashion illustration has a long history that dates back centuries. It began to gain prominence in the late 18th and 19th centuries when fashion magazines and journals started featuring detailed illustrations of the latest clothing and styles. These illustrations played a crucial role in conveying fashion trends and designs to the public before the widespread use of photography,fashion illustration continued to evolve as an art form and became a more expressive and creative medium,rather than simply a means of representing clothing. It remains an important aspect of the fashion industry today,with artists using various techniques and styles to capture the essence of fashion and style.</p>
